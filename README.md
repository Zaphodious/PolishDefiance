# PolishDefiance
A game in which you control the Polish forces at Wizna, as they defend against the vastly more numerous German invasion force.

Currently in early alpha, with golden helmets and red goblins shooting magic bolts at each other.

This game will always be open-source, though the resulting engine will be used in future commercial projects.

Any help is appreciated, even if it's just going to the "Releases" tab, trying the game out, and leaving some feedback.
